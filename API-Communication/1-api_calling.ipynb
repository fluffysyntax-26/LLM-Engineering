      "2.  **Generating Text:** I can write various forms of content, such as:\n",
      "    *   Emails, letters, reports\n",
      "    *   Creative writing (stories, poems, scripts, song lyrics)\n",

      "    *   Summaries of long articles or documents\n",

      "5.  **Language Translation:** I can translate text between many different languages.\n",
      "6.  **Text Rewriting & Rephrasing:** I can rephrase sentences or paragraphs to change their tone, style, or clarity, or to make them more concise.\n",
      "7.  **Brainstorming & Idea Generation:** I can help you brainstorm ideas for projects, topics, names, or creative endeavors.\n",
      "8.  **Conversational Interaction:** I can engage in natural, flowing conversations, remembering context from earlier parts of our chat.\n",

I can also sometimes generate incorrect or nonsensical information (a phenomenon known as \"hallucination\"), so it's always good to verify critical facts.\n",
